# Flash MINI-W1-2CH with OpenBK7231N

This tutorial aims to convert the brand's base smart switch device (tuya) into a generic one to be used, for example, with HomeAssistant.

The device has no manufacturer, neither on them nor on the box. Only the general model is MINI-W1-2CH.
This is based on the BK7231N CB2S system and I flashed with the last OpenBK7231N firmware by [BK7231GUIFlashTool](https://github.com/openshwprojects/BK7231GUIFlashTool) 

The housing is assembled with 4 latches, which release quite easily when lifted. 
You can program without desoldering the module, but you need to desoldering temporarily the CEN pin.
